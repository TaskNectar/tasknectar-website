    <h2>Why Combine PDF Files?</h2>
    <p>
      PDFs are the universal language of documents: they preserve layout, fonts, and formatting across devices. But
      projects rarely live in a single file. You might have invoices, contracts, scanned receipts, worksheets, or slide
      decks split across multiple PDFs. Combining them into one master document keeps things organized and makes
      sharing, printing, and archiving simpler.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Professional delivery:</strong> Send one polished file instead of a messy bundle of attachments.</li>
      <li><strong>Less back-and-forth:</strong> Clients and colleagues can scroll in order‚Äîno guessing which file is next.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy archiving:</strong> Keep project paperwork together for records and audits.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent formatting:</strong> PDF preserves your look and feel exactly as intended.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="quick-steps">
    <h2>Quick Steps: Merge PDFs Online (Free)</h2>
    <p>
      If you want the fastest route with no software to install, use the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a>.
      Here‚Äôs the short version:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a>.</li>
      <li>Click <em>Upload PDFs</em> and select your files (you can add more later).</li>
      <li>Drag to reorder files into the sequence you want.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Rename the final combined file.</li>
      <li>Click <em>Merge PDFs</em> to create a single document.</li>
      <li>Download your merged PDF and share it instantly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That‚Äôs it‚Äîno accounts, no subscriptions. For more control (like rotating a sideways page or removing a cover),
      keep reading.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="detailed-steps">
    <h2>Detailed Walkthrough: Combine PDFs Like a Pro</h2>
    <h3>1) Gather your files</h3>
    <p>
      Save each document as PDF first. If you‚Äôre starting in Word, Google Docs, PowerPoint, or another editor, export
      to PDF to lock in formatting. Consistent page sizes (A4 vs. Letter) and orientation (portrait vs. landscape)
      improve the final look.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Upload to the TaskNectar PDF Merger</h3>
    <p>
      Visit <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a> and click <em>Upload PDFs</em>.
      You can upload multiple files at once. Large PDFs may take a moment to process‚Äîespecially if they include images
      or scans.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Reorder files</h3>
    <p>
      Drag and drop to set the order. Put cover pages and summaries up front; appendices and backup documentation go at
      the end. If your project follows a specific sequence (e.g., <em>Proposal ‚Üí Contract ‚Üí Invoice</em>), mirror that.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Fine-tune page order (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you need granular control‚Äîlike moving a single page from one PDF to the middle of another‚Äîfirst split the PDF
      into pages, then merge in the exact order you want. Use the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-splitter/">TaskNectar PDF Splitter</a>
      to extract pages, then return to the merger.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Rename the output file</h3>
    <p>
      Give the final PDF a meaningful, searchable name, such as <code>Project-Invoice.pdf</code>.
      Good filenames save time for future you, and make it clear to recipients what they‚Äôre opening.
    </p>

    <h3>6) Merge and download</h3>
    <p>
      Click <em>Merge PDFs</em>. The tool combines files in the order you chose and prepares a single download. Before
      you send it, open the merged file and do a quick skim to confirm page order, orientation, and legibility.
    </p>

    <aside aria-label="Pro tip">
      <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you merged scanned pages, text may not be selectable. Consider re-exporting as PDF
      from the original app, or run OCR in your PDF editor if you need searchable text.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="mac-windows">
    <h2>Merging PDFs on Mac &amp; Windows (No Extra Software Required)</h2>
    <h3>Mac (Preview)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the first PDF in <em>Preview</em>.</li>
      <li>Show the sidebar thumbnails (<em>View ‚Üí Thumbnails</em>).</li>
      <li>Drag other PDFs (or specific pages) into the sidebar at the desired position.</li>
      <li>Reorder pages by dragging thumbnails.</li>
      <li>Go to <em>File ‚Üí Export as PDF</em> (or <em>File ‚Üí Save</em>) to create the merged PDF.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>
      Windows doesn‚Äôt include a native ‚Äúmerge‚Äù feature directly in File Explorer. You can either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the web-based <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a> for a quick, free merge, or</li>
      <li>Use a desktop PDF application that supports combining files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For occasional merges, the browser-based approach is usually faster and avoids installing extra software.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="mobile">
    <h2>How to Combine PDFs on Mobile (iOS &amp; Android)</h2>
    <p>
      You can merge PDFs on your phone or tablet using the same online tool:
      open <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a> in your mobile browser, upload from
      your device, Files app, Google Drive, or similar, then reorder and merge. It‚Äôs handy for scanning receipts and
      combining them into one expense report on the go.
    </p>
    <aside aria-label="Mobile best practices">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> On mobile, scans can be large. If you run into size limits, compress images before uploading
      or scan at a lower resolution that still preserves text legibility.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="order-rotate">
    <h2>Reorder, Rotate &amp; Remove Pages</h2>
    <p>
      Clean structure matters. Before sharing your merged document:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reorder:</strong> Place summaries and key documents first; put supporting materials in appendices.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate:</strong> Fix sideways scans so recipients can read without turning their head or screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove:</strong> Delete duplicate covers, placeholder pages, or mis-scans (like a blank page).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you need to surgically extract or remove specific pages, do that first with the
      <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-splitter/">PDF Splitter</a>, then merge the exact pages you want.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="quality-size">
    <h2>Keep Quality High &amp; Manage File Size</h2>
    <p>
      Two factors determine the size and quality of your final PDF: image resolution and embedded fonts. Here‚Äôs how to
      keep things crisp without creating a monster file:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start with vector originals when possible:</strong> Export to PDF from Word, PowerPoint, or design apps rather than scanning printed pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Use reasonable scan settings:</strong> 150‚Äì300 DPI is enough for most office documents; higher DPI inflates file size with little benefit for text.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid repeated re-saving:</strong> Each export or print-to-PDF pass can bloat or rasterize pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Compress images before merging:</strong> If any PDFs are mostly photos, pre-compress them.</li>
      <li><strong>Check fonts:</strong> Embedded fonts keep layout consistent across devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After merging, if the file is larger than you‚Äôd like, consider exporting a ‚Äúreduced size‚Äù version in your PDF
      editor‚Äîor re-create the original files with more efficient settings and merge again.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="security-privacy">
    <h2>Security &amp; Privacy Tips for Sensitive Documents</h2>
    <p>
      PDFs often contain confidential data‚Äîcontracts, IDs, payroll, or financials. Follow these best practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Review every page:</strong> Ensure no internal notes or draft pages made it into the final merge.</li>
      <li><strong>Redact properly:</strong> Use a redaction tool (not just drawing black boxes) if you must hide sensitive info.</li>
      <li><strong>Password-protect when needed:</strong> If sharing by email, consider encrypting or using a secure link.</li>
      <li><strong>Check policies:</strong> When using web tools, review the site‚Äôs privacy policy and data handling practices to understand how files are processed.</li>
      <li><strong>Retain originals:</strong> Keep your source files so you can regenerate if needed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="troubleshooting">
    <h2>Troubleshooting: Why Won‚Äôt My PDFs Combine?</h2>
    <h3>‚ÄúThe file is too large‚Äù</h3>
    <p>Large image-heavy PDFs (e.g., scans) can hit upload or email limits. Compress images, split the file, or merge in batches.</p>

    <h3>‚ÄúPages are sideways or upside down‚Äù</h3>
    <p>Rotate the affected pages before or after the merge. Most PDF tools let you rotate individual pages.</p>

    <h3>‚ÄúThe text looks fuzzy‚Äù</h3>
    <p>If you exported by printing to PDF from a web browser or screenshotting, you may have rasterized text. Export directly to PDF from the source app, then merge.</p>

    <h3>‚ÄúThe order isn‚Äôt right‚Äù</h3>
    <p>Double-check the file list before merging. If you need fine-grained page control, split first, then merge in exact sequence.</p>

    <h3>‚ÄúI need only some pages from one file‚Äù</h3>
    <p>Use the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-splitter/">PDF Splitter</a> to extract specific pages, then run the merger.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="workflow-examples">
    <h2>Real-World Workflows That Benefit from Merging PDFs</h2>
    <h3>1) Client Deliverables</h3>
    <p>
      Combine your proposal, contract, and first invoice into a single PDF. The client sees a polished, complete packet
      that‚Äôs easy to approve and pay.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Expense Reports</h3>
    <p>
      Snap receipts throughout the month with your phone, export them as PDFs, and merge into one report. Pair it with
      a summary sheet at the front for quick reviews.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Legal &amp; HR Documents</h3>
    <p>
      Onboarding packs (policies, forms, ID checks) are clearer when combined into one document with a table of
      contents up front.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Education &amp; Training</h3>
    <p>
      Merge lesson plans, handouts, and assessments into one booklet so students or trainees download a single file.
    </p>

    <h3>5) Sales &amp; Marketing</h3>
    <p>
      Combine brochures, datasheets, and case studies. A single ‚Äúpitch pack‚Äù reduces friction in the sales cycle.
    </p>

    <h3>6) Project Archives</h3>
    <p>
      At project close, merge key docs (briefs, approvals, change logs, deliverables) into a final archive stored in
      your knowledge base for fast reference later.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="alternatives">
    <h2>Alternatives: When to Split, Compress, or Re-Export</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Split instead of merge:</strong> If a document‚Äôs too long or you only need a section, use the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-splitter/">PDF Splitter</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Compress:</strong> If email rejects your merged file, compress images or export a ‚Äúreduced size‚Äù version in your PDF app.</li>
      <li><strong>Re-export:</strong> If text is blurry, export to PDF directly from the source app rather than printing to PDF or screenshotting.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2>FAQ: Combining PDF Files</h2>

    <h3>Is it free to combine PDFs?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes‚Äîusing the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-merger/">TaskNectar PDF Merger</a> lets you combine multiple PDFs online at no cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Will merging change my document quality?</h3>
    <p>
      Merging keeps original pages intact. If you notice fuzziness, it‚Äôs usually because the source file was a low-resolution scan or a rasterized export.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I merge specific pages only?</h3>
    <p>
      Absolutely. First extract the pages you need with the <a href="https://tasknectar.com/pdf-splitter/">PDF Splitter</a>, then merge those pages into a new file.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it safe to merge PDFs online?</h3>
    <p>
      For general documents, online tools are convenient. For highly sensitive files, review the site‚Äôs privacy policy and consider redaction or encryption before sharing.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I keep page numbers consistent?</h3>
    <p>
      Add page numbers in your source app before exporting to PDF, or use a PDF editor to stamp page numbers on the merged file.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is my merged file so big?</h3>
    <p>
      Large images and scans inflate size. Use lower DPI for scans (150‚Äì300 for text), compress images, or export a reduced-size PDF.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I reorder pages after merging?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes‚Äîsplit the merged file into pages, rearrange as needed, and merge again. This gives precise control over structure.
